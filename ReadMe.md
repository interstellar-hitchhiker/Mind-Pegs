In the memory matching game, players use "mind pegs" and "mnemonics" to enhance their memory recall and make gameplay more enjoyable. Here's how these techniques work and how they benefit the gaming experience:

Mind Pegs:

Mind pegs are mental hooks or cues that aid in recalling information. Each number from 1 to 20 serves as a mind peg, providing a framework for memory recall.
Players associate each number with a specific word or image on the card. For example, when they see the number 1, they connect it with the word "Flag" or an image of a flag on the card.
By linking numbers to familiar words or images, players create a mental peg system that simplifies the process of remembering matching pairs during gameplay.
Visual pegs are employed for numbers 1 to 10 and number 20, while auditory or sound-based pegs are used for numbers 11 to 19. For instance, "10+2 Shoe" associates the number 12 with the word "Shoe."

Mnemonics:

Mnemonics are memory aids that facilitate information recall by creating associations, patterns, or rhymes.
In the game, mnemonics are used to establish memorable connections between numbers and words or images. For numbers 11 to 19, mnemonics based on rhymes or sound associations are utilized.
For instance, "10+1 Gun" connects the number 11 with the word "Gun," and "10+3 Bee" associates the number 13 with the word "Bee."
By leveraging mnemonics, players can utilize auditory cues to reinforce memory and recall matching pairs more effectively.
Overall, mind pegs and mnemonics provide players with structured methods for memory recall, enhancing the gameplay experience by adding an element of mental challenge and engagement.

Now, let's briefly go over the functions and logic of the code:

The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It presents a memory matching game where players flip cards to find matching pairs.
The startGame() function initializes the game board, shuffles the cards, and starts the timer.
Players can flip cards by clicking on them. The flipCard() function handles card flipping and checks for matches.
When a match is found, the checkMatch() function updates the game state and checks if all pairs have been matched.
Players can toggle the theme, change difficulty, and use hints using the control buttons.
